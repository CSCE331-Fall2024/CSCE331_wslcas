            <p>I'd like to get more involved in local service projects at A&M and in my community. I enjoy helping
                people with their schoolwork and being a good general resource for those around me. Overall, my main
                goal is to be able to affect others' lives in a positive way.</p>

        One service activity I want to get involved in is peer tutoring. I think it will allow me to help people around
        me and also help me become more knowledgeable.
