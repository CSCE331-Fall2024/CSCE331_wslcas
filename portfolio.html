            <p>Projects have greatly improved my professional and interpersonal skills. I
                appreciate
                getting to obtain hands-on experience outside of school. Here are some of my favorite projects!</p>

                <h3>Drone Connections</h3>
                <p class="p2-1">In the Summer of 2023, I had the privilege of interning for Eve Vehicles, a drone
                    startup affiliated with the University of Texas Center for Electromechanics (CEM). Working in a
                    professional development environment was an entirely new experience for me. It wasn't a typical
                    internship, I was given lots of freedom to solve the problems the team was facing, which was super
                    exciting! This was difficult in the beginning because I didn't have much experience with the
                    technologies they
                    were using. I wanted to avoid weighing down a team that had much more work than they had employees
                    (the engineering team was 3 people! &lt;insert joke about startup life&gt;). I am proud that I was
                    able to become self-sufficient in the technologies being used, and made concrete contributions to
                    the future of the project. I constructed the whole pipeline of flight log retrieval, which spanned
                    from automating the log retrieval from the flight controller's companion computer to adding features
                    to the UI that allowed for easy and efficient access to the logs.</p>
